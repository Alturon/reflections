When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repositories are helpful in keeping
	project files in a safe place. Even if my
	local machine dies, hope not, I could still
	have all my	files of the repository safe and
	sound at the remote repository on GitHub.
	Certainly there are other benefits to having
	a remote repository, for example, having a
	public remote repository can help in sharing
	and collaborating with others on your
	project.
