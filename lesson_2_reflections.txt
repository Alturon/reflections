What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Only after initializing a directory that a
	directory can be considered a git repository.
	git init creates the necessary file (.git) so
	that git recognizes it as a repository and
	all then all the git functions would be
	available. Now it would possible using git
	to keep track of versions of files in that
	directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By comparing the staging area to the latest
	commit, using git diff --staged, differences
	can be found; if they are significant enough
	to be considered as logically different, then
	we can make a commit.
